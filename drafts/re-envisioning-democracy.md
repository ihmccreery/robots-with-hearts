Making technology work for us

> We are living in an isolation that would have been unimaginable to our ancestors, and yet we have never been more accessible.

> [...] within this world of instant and absolute communication, unbounded by limits of time or space, we suffer from unprecedented alienation. We have never been more detached from one another, or lonelier. In a world consumed by ever more novel modes of socializing, we have less and less actual society. We live in an accelerating contradiction: the more connected we become, the lonelier we are. We were promised a global village; instead we inhabit the drab cul-de-sacs and endless freeways of a vast suburb of information.

> [*The Social Network*]'s most indelible scene, the one that may well have earned it an Oscar, was the final, silent shot of an anomic Zuckerberg sending out a friend request to his ex-girlfriend, then waiting and clicking and waiting and clicking—a moment of superconnected loneliness preserved in amber. We have all been in that scene: transfixed by the glare of a screen, hungering for response.

> FACEBOOK ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE of a dramatic increase in the quantity and intensity of human loneliness, a rise that initially made the site’s promise of greater connection seem deeply attractive. Americans are more solitary than ever before.

> [...] it is not just isolation that is rising sharply. It’s loneliness, too. And loneliness makes us miserable.

> A 2010 AARP survey found that 35 percent of adults older than 45 were chronically lonely, as opposed to 20 percent of a similar group only a decade earlier. According to a major study by a leading scholar of the subject, roughly 20 percent of Americans—about 60 million people—are unhappy with their lives because of loneliness. Across the Western world, physicians and nurses have begun to speak openly of an epidemic of loneliness.

> The decrease in confidants—that is, in quality social connections—has been dramatic over the past 25 years. In one survey, the mean size of networks of personal confidants decreased from 2.94 people in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. Similarly, in 1985, only 10 percent of Americans said they had no one with whom to discuss important matters, and 15 percent said they had only one such good friend. By 2004, 25 percent had nobody to talk to, and 20 percent had only one confidant.

> In the face of this social disintegration, we have essentially hired an army of replacement confidants, an entire class of professional carers [...] We have outsourced the work of everyday caring.

Note here that we might want to talk about *The Invisible Heart* & Nancy Folbre's work.

> Loneliness is at the American core, a by-product of a long-standing national appetite for independence [...]

References *Bowling Alone*.

> We are lonely because we want to be lonely. We have made ourselves lonely.

> The question of the future is this: Is Facebook part of the separating or part of the congregating; is it a huddling-together for warmth or a shuffling-away in pain?

Stopped reading at: "WELL BEFORE FACEBOOK ..."

It's time to make the move from housed, well-fed, and entertained to housed, well-fed, and {fulfilled, happy}. Right now we look to our things to make us happy. They never will. Only people can love one another.

Where Engineers Fit In

How does Uncle Bob Martin's "trade oath" relate to Robots with Hearts?

engineers control the world: if they refuse to work, then what?

In the early days of medicine, did doctors do terrible things? We're in that age of engineering.
