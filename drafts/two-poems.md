Two Poems

2014
---

I walk along the beach,  
And my knuckles hurt  
As I grasp my pencil, my dagger.
 
“Stop them,” she said,  
“Stop them from crashing.”  
"You have to," she said,  
"I need to you to stop the waves."

I walk to the sea,  
And my feet sink into the warm sand.

The waves?  
With a pencil?  
Impossible.

His brown hair was combed neatly back,  
And his teeth shone bright as he laughed.  
"It's like trying to boil the ocean!  
When all you have, my dear boy, is a match!"

"Ha!" he bellowed, nine feet tall,  
"It just won't work."

The Promised Land
---

If only we could just make it a little further, friend,  
Our planet would stop baking,  
And our people would stop hating.

I could love you like I've always wanted,  
Let it all out from within,  
And we could forgive each other's original sins.

Just a little further, friend!  
To the promised land!  
You hung photographs of our fathers' promised lands:

Peru ... colonized;  
Detroit ... left for dead;  
Japan ... soon gone as the heat you can't feel spreads.

Just a little further, friend!  
To the promised land,  
With your hand in my cold hand.
