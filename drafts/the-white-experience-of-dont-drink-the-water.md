Still Don't Drink the Water
===

*Isaac Hollander McCreery, 27 January 2014*

In 2003, Dave Matthews Band played and recorded a concert in Central Park, New York City.  The concert started with a long, slow, building introduction of 3:18, (longer than most *Beatles* songs, I might add).  Then, after a burst of saxophone and guitar and drums,

> Come out, come out, no use in hiding!  
Come now, come now, can you not see?  
There's no place here, what were you expecting?  
Now, not room for both, just room for me.

> [Say/So] you will lay your arms down.  
Yes, I will call this [home/mine]!

> Away, away, you have been banished!  
Oh, your land is gone and given to me.  
[And here] I will spread my wings!  
Yes, I will call this [home/mine]!

> What's this you say,  
You feel the right to remain?  
Then stay,  
And I will bury you!

> [gibberish]

> What's this you say,  
Your father's spirit still lives in this place?  
Well, I will silence you!

> [gibberish]

> Here's the hitch, your horse is leaving.  
Don't miss your boat, it's leaving now.

> [Unless/And as] you go I will spread my wings.  
Yes, I will call this [mine/home].

> Well I have no time to justify to you.  
Fool you're blind!  
Move aside for me!

> [And] all I can say to you my new neighbor  
Is, you must move on,  
Or I will bury you!

> Now as I rest my feet by this fire,  
Those hands once warmed here,  
Well, I have retired them.
I can breathe my own air,  
And I can sleep more soundly.  
Upon these poor souls,

> [I'll build heaven and call it home  
'Cause you're all dead now.]

> And I live with my justice,  
And I live with my greedy need.

> And I live with no mercy,  
And I live with my frenzied feeding.

> And I live with my hatred,  
And I live with my jealosy.

> And I live with the notion,  
I don't need anyone but me.

> Don't drink the water!  
Don't drink the water!  
There's blood in the water.  
Don't drink the water!

> Don't drink the water!  
Don't drink the water!  
There's blood in the water.  
Don't drink the water!

> [gibberish]

> Don't drink the water!  
Don't drink the water!  
Don't drink the water!  
Don't drink the water!  
There's blood in the water.

> [gibberish?]

Anyone who is familiar with Dave Matthews Band with recognize these lyrics as "Don't Drink the Water".  As of this writing, Wikipedia states that, "the subject of the song is the apartheid in South Africa and the persecution of the Native Americans."

This is *so* still alive.

Gentrification (I will bury you) -> high tech
